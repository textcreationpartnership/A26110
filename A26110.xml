            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T may truly be af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm'd that Nature made an equal Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition of all her Goods amongſt her Children, the Eagle and Hawk for Sight, the Hound for Sent, the Lilly and Peacock for gay Cloathing;
<pb facs="tcp:55889:3"/>Birds, Beaſts, and Fiſhes went away alike ſatisfi'd and pleas'd with their Sate and Condition. Man in this Diſtribution (whilſt he retain'd his Innocency) was Gods Vicegerent upon Earth, and beſides the Enjoyment of the World, and the Command of all Creatures, he had alſo Fellowſhip with Angels; but failing of his Allegiance, he was ſoon degraded of his Dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, and became ſubject unto manifold Miſeries, and even to Death it ſelf; yet in his fallen Eſtate there is to be ſeen ſome Marks of his Divine Original. The Heathen Poet ſings of him, <hi>Os homini ſublime dedit Coelum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>que
<pb facs="tcp:55889:3"/>tueri.</hi> That he is not a Child of Earth like other Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, but chiefly made to Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>template Heavenly things, of an erect Countenance, fitly fram'd with two Eyes, won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfully made to view the Works of God's Hands. It is true, the Natural Imbecillity, as of others, ſo of our Viſive Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gans, doth not permit us to take ſo full a view as we could wiſh of Bodies that are always at great diſtances, therefore Men by their Induſtry have invent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed arts to ſupply this defect, and amongſt many, the Tele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcope (which occaſion'd the enſuing Treatiſe) is one of the
<pb facs="tcp:55889:4"/>moſt uſeful and curious Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments that has hitherto been diſcover'd. By the help of it, Men are in ſome meaſure re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtor'd unto their firſt Dignity, and ſomewhat enabled to ſee and Contemplate the wonderful frame and diſpoſition of the Heavens and Heavenly Bodies, and thereby raiſe their thoughts and affections from Earthly groſs and mean Objects, to ſuch, which from a <hi>Primum Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bile,</hi> may advance them to the firſt Mover and Creator of all things. But as the Eye of nature carries us but a little part of this way, ſo alſo this Artificial Eye falls very far
<pb facs="tcp:55889:4"/>ſhort of the Mark; and though it communicates unto us ſome imperfect glimmerings of the Stars, Firmament, and Lower Heavens, yet it there leaves us at a loſs; ſo that 'tis abſolutely neceſſary to take ſome other help to gaide us to the ſight and fruition of the Supream Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs, and that is the Eye of Faith, purely abſtracted from all Senſitive Matter, which alone can penetrate through the Fogs and thick Vapours of the Air, and can like the Eagle ſtedfaſtly (through the Veil of the Firmament) behold the Sun of Righteouſneſs. This Eye is only to be obtain'd by
<pb facs="tcp:55889:5"/>the conſtant and Conſcionable hearing and reading the Word of God, which by ſome years Experience I obſerv'd you to perform, and queſtion not your perſeverance therein, having receiv'd as many and great Bleſſings from His Liberal Hand as any Heart can reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably wiſh.</p>
            <p>A Perſon of Quality, unto whom I have a thouſand Obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations, was pleas'd lately to ſhew me the following Colle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions of Diſcoveries, made by many famous Aſtronomers of <hi>Europe</hi> touching the Planets and ſome others Stars, intimating
<pb facs="tcp:55889:5"/>that the time would not be ill ſpent to render it into <hi>Engliſh.</hi> I being very ſenſible of his great Wiſdom and Judgment, readily contributed my weak Endeavours to communicate it unto all that are Well Wiſhers unto theſe Sublime Speculations; And having for an Age paſt been ambitious to give ſome publick Demonſtration unto the World (as I have done in ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral particular Rencounters unto your ſelf) of my Grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude for the many Favours you have been pleas'd on all occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions to confer upon me both in City and Country; Although

               <p>THe Teleſcope or great Proſpective-Glaſs was invented in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of this Age, before which time none in the World had know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of it. Formerly it was made very little and ſhort, but ſinding that it repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentede Objects much better being made in a larger form, it is now made 20, 30, and unto 60, or 80 foot long, whereby Object; at great diſtance are clearly and more di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinctly ſeen and diſcovered. Some do judge
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:55889:8"/>they may be made of ſuch a capacity, or improv'd to ſuch form, that by them may be ſeen the Inhabitants or Animals, which by ſome are pretended to be in the Moon; Wherefore according to the Opinion of Mr. <hi>Azout,</hi> the matters hereafter mentioned, appear but as Objects of 60, or 70 Leagues diſtant. We will here report the Teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of ſeveral famous Artiſts and Aſtrono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers, who by the means of this Inſtrument have made their Obſervations upon the Stars and Heavens, each in their own Country, <hi>viz.</hi> ſome at <hi>Paris,</hi> others at <hi>Rome,</hi> others at <hi>London,</hi> and others in ſeveral other places of <hi>Europe.</hi>

               <p n="2">2. That every one of the Planets, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept the Sun, change their Faces like the Moon; ſo that <hi>Venus</hi> and <hi>Mercury</hi> do ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:55889:8"/>appear like a half Moon, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times quite round, according as theſe Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nets are found more or leſs oppoſite unto the Sun. That <hi>Mars</hi> ſometimes appears in a Curvy Lin'd Figure. That <hi>Saturn</hi> ſhews himſelf as encompaſſed with a Ring. Tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching <hi>Jupiter</hi> it is very marvelous, That there are diſcovered four little Stars that continually move Circularly about his Body, and which by that means caſt a ſhade upon his Superficies. Theſe things are undeniable Teſtimonies, that all theſe Planets have no other Light, but that which the Sun com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municates unto them.</p>
               <p n="3">3. This Teleſcope doth alſo inform us, that each of theſe Planets, except the Sun, have ſpots in their Superficies, juſt as the Moon hath, and of the ſame kind of black<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</p>
               <p n="4">4.

               <p>TOuching the fixed Stars, it is mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velous that the ſame Four things which we have obſerved to be in the Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nets, are alſo found to meet in them. Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon it is to be obſerved, that from time to time by help of the ſame Inſtrument, there is diſcovered new Stars in the Firmament, the which having appeared a certain time, do ſo decreaſe of their bigneſs, that they cannot any longer be diſcerned; and then afterwards, after the revolution of Months, Years, or Ages, do appear again, as if they were newly come into being. This Wonder hath given occaſion unto Aſtronomers and Modern Optiſts to conclude, that it is the ſame with the Stars, as with the Pſanets; and that at leaſt ſome of them, have Spots and Blemiſhes, and that they alſo move as thoſe do, on their Centers; From whence it proceeds, that when their Spects are turn'd towards the Earth, they do not appear unto us; and when the Spots are turn'd t'other way behind, then they do appear by means ports an evident deciſion of the Queſtion unto this day controverted, to wit, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:55889:9"/>theſe Stars ſhine of their own proper Light, or of the Light borrowed from the Sun-Beams, and we muſt hold it in favour of the Affirmative, that they ſhine by vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of the Illumination of this great Planet; which is the point we have Eſtabliſhed in the firſt part of our <hi>Anticopernicus;</hi> There be a great many obſervable and curious things to be ſeen in this firſt Part. As for the Stars which are permanent, or do al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways ſhine, it may probably be ſaid, that they always continue ſuch, becauſe that by their moving upon their Center, they have little or no Spots. Moreover this Proſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive diſcovers unto us in the Heavens, a far greater number of Stars than what we can diſcern with the naked Eye. It diſcovers unto us in the Pleiades, in a Circle of one degree of Diameter which encompaſſeth them, the number of 46 Stars, whereas we can perceive in that little company but ſix, the ſeventh having diſappeared a long time agone.</p>
               <p>Behold here alſo another great marvel in the fixed Stars, which is, that when they are beheld with th Teleſcope, the appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo prodigiouſly ſmall, that whereas <hi>Tycho B.</hi> tells us that thoſe of the firſt Magnitude appear unto the naked ſight about two Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents Diameter; they appear not unto us, according unto <hi>Galilco,</hi> but five Seconds of a
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:55889:10"/>Diameter, which is twenty four times leſs. And whereas <hi>Tycho B.</hi> makes theſe Stars to be 60 or 70 times bigger than the Earth; at this time, on the contrary, they are found to be 200 time leſs than the Earth. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon <hi>Kepler</hi> warns us, that with the Tele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcope the greatneſs of any fixed Star cannot be determined, becauſe by how much the better the Glaſs is, by ſo much the leſſer the Stars appear. It is a matter of ſurpriſe to hear, that all the Planets do appear greater in the Glaſs than they are, eſpecially the loweſt; and then again theſe fixed Stars on the contrary, with the ſame Glaſs, do ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear ſmaller. I adhere unto this Opinion of the prodigious ſmallneſs of fixed Stars; Nevertheleſs at preſent I judge, that as to this matter, there is ſome kind of fallacy in our ſight. Hereafter we will make a far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Demonſtration.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, The Teleſcope has diſcover'd and decided the Queſtion which hath been ſo long agitated amongſt the ancient Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers, namely, what the is which we call the Milky Way, vulgarly in <hi>French</hi> the Way of St. <hi>James;</hi> for it has given us to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand, that 'tis nothing but an infinite mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude of ſmall Stars, which by their near<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs one to another, make up all that white Tract which we behold in the Heavens.</p>

               <p>BY help of the aboveſaid Inſtrument, there has been obſerved upon the Convexity of the Body of the Sun, black Spots which are moveable, variable, and ſubject to change, and which do move re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gularly towards the Weſt, finiſhing their Revolution in 26 or 27 days. Neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs <hi>Hevelius</hi> here traces theſe ways by bend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, ſometimes Convex, and ſometimes Hollow. The motions of theſe Solar Spots teſtifie unto us, that the Body of the Sun truns upon this Center, with that motion. Theſe Spots are not Celeſtial Bodies, as <hi>J. Tarde</hi> would make us believe, but rather Eva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porations which riſe from the Body of the Sun, after the manner of Vapours ariſing from the Earth, and forming themſelves in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Clouds; which doth appear, inaſmuch as theſe Spots are always chageable in their form, bulk, and configuration. Sometimes there appears a great number in the Face of this Star: ſometimes but a few, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times none at all. Some of theſe Spots ſhine and become lightſom, and others that ſhined become dark. To this purpoſe <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lapert</hi> at <hi>Arras</hi> did dayly obſerve theſe Spots,
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:55889:11"/>from the year 1618. unto the year 1627. and never found them return unto the ſame Configuration they had in all that time. <hi>Scheiner</hi> on the other hand obſerved them at <hi>Rome</hi> at the ſame time, and found them no otherwiſe than the former had done.</p>
               <p>It were to be wiſhed that ſome of theſe. Solar Spots had remained fixed in the Body of the Sun, for that would have decided the great Queſtion, to wit, if it be the Earth, or the Sun, which is immovable in the Center of the Univerſe.</p>

               <p>Alſo, Wherefore at certain times it was, that this Star appeared not in his wonted brightneſs, as it happened in the year 1547. from the 24<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of <hi>Auguſt</hi> unto the 28<hi rend="sup">th</hi>. that the Sun appeared reddiſh, and not as bright as the Moon in her total Eclips, ſo that ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Stars were viſible at Noon-Day.</p>

               <p>BEſides what is commonly to be ſeen in the Moon by the naked Eye, to wit, that ſhe changeth her Face according as ſhe turns towards the Sun, and that together with what Light ſhe hath, ſhe hath alſo black Irregular Spots; the ſame Inſtrument hath farther inform'd us, that the Lucid parts of her Body are Rugged and Protube<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant, and as ſome conjecture, is like the Earth; and the reſt which conſiſts in Spots, as the ſame Authors ſay, reſembles the Sea. Alſo that the Surface of this Planet is ſet all over with certain round hollows like Pits or Wells, of ſeveral Magnitudes, all and every of which, ſome unadviſedly take to be ſo many Mountains; but that they are rather a kind of Cavities, and liker Wells or Pits than Mountains, is apparent, in regard their ſhade is towards the Sun and not oppoſite, that is to ſay, beyond theſe Concavities or Wells.</p>
               <p>And theſe be all the Shades which is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable in the Diſque of the Moon, for to imagine as a great many do, that theſe Spots are ſo many Shadows produced by the Sun, by reaſon of Hills and Valleys, which
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:55889:13"/>all Antiquity ſuppoſed to be in the Moon, is not true; for when the Moon is full and oppoſite to the Sun, theſe pretended Shades in this Planet ſhould by conſequence diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear, which yet is not ſo. Note, That in our Figure, all the aboveſaid hollows, are repreſented without ſhade, becauſe being a Figure of the Full Moon, the Sun doth throughly enlighten them at other times, as at the Quarters, they ſhew themſelves ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in the part towards the Sun.</p>
               <p>And although the Face of the Moon is full of Wrinkles, yet nevertheleſs there ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears no Shadow, whether it be that the Shades of theſe Wrinkles are inſenſible for their ſmalneſs, or elſe that they be tranſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent to the Sun Beams, which is the Opinion of <hi>Galileo,</hi> who eſteems the Moon to be like the Mother of Pearl, ſhewing knobs and red<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs where there is none.</p>
               <p>It is true that ſome of theſe Wells or Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows ſeem to be all black in the Full Moon, but that is without doubt, becauſe that theſe Cavities are of the nature of the Spots whereof we ſpeak.</p>
               <p>The Diameter of theſe Wells or Pits con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider'd in regard of the Moon, which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains about 650 <hi>French</hi> Leagues, contain ſome more ſome leſs; the greateſt of all is that of <hi>A. B.</hi> which by computation con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains about 20 Leagues.</p>
               <pb n="12" facs="tcp:55889:14"/>
               <p> Let us farther obſerve in this Planet the admirable mixture of its Lucidities and Spots, thoſe ſurpriſing Varieties, thoſe Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblanoes of Foreſts of Foreſts of Ruſhes which ſeem ſcatter'd here and there: thoſe kinds of Spiders Legs: thoſe kinds of Polygones, and eſpecially the appearances of Beams of Light ariſing out of theſe profound Wells, as of the aboveſaid <hi>A. B.</hi> To conclude, all the great variety of theſe things cannot ſeem to happen by chance, but that they were ſo diſpoſed by the Soveraign Creator, for ſome end and reaſon unknown unto us; And indeed the Eighth <hi>Pſalm</hi> informs us, that this Planet, as alſo the Stars, is the work of Gods Fingers.</p>
               <p>Mark the word, Fingers.</p>
               <p>All which being conſider'd, and for o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Reaſons, we cannot ſay that the Moon is a World filled with Inhabitants, Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals, and Plants, as many ancient Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers have imagin'd; but rather a certain Vapour or Cloud, probably condenſed with Cold, which is evident, inaſmuch as this Star by day appears as a common Cloud; which Cloud were it raiſed to the height of the Moon, and that it were as big, it would ſhine in the Night after the ſame manner. Add hereunto, that the Pillar of the Cloud which conducted the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> in the Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs, was a Cloud by Day, and a Pillar
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:55889:14"/>of Fire by Night. We judge that all the Stars of Heaven, except the Sun, are of the ſame ſubſtance the Moon is of.</p>
               <p>It is moreover a great wonder that this Nocturnal Light, appears unto us here be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, to have borrow'd the likeneſs of a Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans Face in her Diſque. <hi>Plutarch</hi> hath writ a Treatiſe expresſly, wherein he ſaith this Figure of a Human Face, was in the Mouth and Hands of all the World; al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though it is certain that ſome of great Wit and exquiſit Judgment, do proteſt they do not perceive any Image of a Womans Face in this Planet. But <hi>Plutarch</hi> himſelf gives a Reaſon of this miſtake, ſaying, that it is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe thoſe People have the ſight low and weak, uncapable of well perceiving the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neaments of this Face; or rather, it is becauſe their thoughts are not intent upon the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign, Picture, or Portraicture. For my part before I attained to be Six years of Age, I al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready fancy'd the form of a Face in this Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>net, which alſo moſt People in the World think they do.</p>
               <p>Beſides let us obſerve this Face in the Moon with the Teleſcope, and let us conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der it altogether, and ſeverally; then you will ſay, this Human Face will no more be ſeen, but only certain Irregular Vapours without any order, which have no likeneſs unto any Repreſentation whatſoever.</p>
               <p n="1">
                  <pb n="14" facs="tcp:55889:15"/> 1. Our Teleſcope hath alſo inform'd us, that there is firſt an Atmoſphere, or Orb, which is ſuppoſed to be of a very thin Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porous Air, which encompaſſeth all the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perficies of the Moon; as round the Earth there conſiſts the like Orb of Vaporous and Cloudy Air, which containeth the firſt Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gions of the Air.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The Teleſcope hath farther given us to underſtand a thing very ſurpriſing in the Moon, which is, that in her Eclipſe, when it is Eclipſed a Fingers breadth or two, to the Naked Eye, it is not at all Eclipſed if you look on it with the Teleſcope; and when it is quite freed from the Eclipſe in the Teleſcope, it yet appears to be Eclipſed a Finger or two's breadth to the naked Eye. Upon this matter ſee the <hi>Hydrogr.</hi> of Father <hi>Fournier,</hi> wherein are given ſome Examples of this Phenomenon.</p>
               <p n="3">3. This Teleſcope hath farther given us the knowledge of a thing more ſtrange and wonderful, to wit, that although the Moon being low near the <hi>Horizon,</hi> appears greater unto the naked Eye, and being mounted towards the <hi>Zenith</hi> appears leſs; it is found, that when its Viſual Diameter comes to be meaſured in both theſe places, the quite contrary doth appear; to wit, that ſhe is leſs when ſhe is low near the <hi>Horizon,</hi> and greater when ſhe is mounted towards the <hi>Zenith.</hi>

Let us add another point no leſs ſurpriſing, which is, that although that which is Il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luminated in the Moon proceeds from the Rays of the Sun darted directly upon her; When this brightneſs comes to be examin'd, it is found that in all likelihood it is not car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry'd in a direct Line, but in a crooked, and ſeems not to proceed from the Sun as from its Source, but ordinarily from another Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple higher and more eminent.

               <p>TIme out of mind it hath been conceived that this Planet <hi>Saturn,</hi> conſiſted in one entire round Globe; but now by help of this Teleſcope, we diſcover that it is compoſed of two parts, and that indeed it is round in reſpect of its Body, but doth beſides conſiſt of a Ring, which is Lumi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous by means of the enlightning of the Sun, as <hi>Saturn</hi> himſelf is Luminous by the ſame means; which Ring encompaſſeth him all round after the ſame manner that the <hi>Horizon</hi> of our Artificial Globes encom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſeth their Globes, and is flat upon the Verge as they be.

Upon this change of Figure, wherein <hi>Saturn</hi> at certain times appears, Aſtronomers have well concluded, that in effect he moves in himſelf, and that it was neceſſary this Circle ſhould be flat like a Bourlet; and that the reaſon wherefore he diſappeared at certain times, proceeded, that at that time, he was as to us, turned Proſil, and ſhewed us the ſide, and was not enlightned with the Sun on the ſide turned towards us. Moreover, Obſervations have given us to underſtand, that this Planet moves upon his own Center, and upon his Own Ax, to wit, under the <hi>Eaſt,</hi> to the <hi>Weſt,</hi> as has been obſerv'd by <hi>Hugens, Caſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiny,</hi> and others.

Mr. <hi>Caſſiny</hi> took notice of it, and did not ſufficiently, nor ſcarce at all underſtand it, until the year 1666. which he did not then neither, ſaith he, without much difficulty. He found that it had Spots upon its Surface juſt as the Moon has; to wit, two, which are very thi, long, and uncertainly terminated; amongſt which at the ſeventh place marked 7, appears a ſhining part. He found by means of theſe Spots, that the motion of this Planet and of its Spots, was made up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on its own Center, and upon an Ax which carry'd it from <hi>South</hi> to <hi>North,</hi> which is a motion wholly unknown in the Heavens;
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:55889:23"/>and that this motion was accompliſht in one day, whether it be, ſaith he, of Revolution or Libration.</p>

               </head>
               <p>THe firſt new Star come unto our know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, is that which appeared in the time of <hi>Hypparcus,</hi> about 125 years before the Birth of our Saviour Jeſus Chriſt; Since which time ſome others have alſo been diſcovered; to wit, one in the year 388. whereof <hi>Claudian</hi> makes mention: and one in the fifteenth Degree of <hi>Scorpio,</hi> ſpoken of by <hi>Albumazar Haly,</hi> the which conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued four Months. Since which time, in the year 1571. the Ninth of <hi>November,</hi> there appeared in the Firmament in the Chair of <hi>Caſſiopea,</hi> that notable Star of the firſt Magnitude, which in its Courſe go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verned it ſelf like the other Stars, as hold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing place amongſt them, and had no Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lax. The Aſtronomers of thoſe times well obſerved it, for Inſtance <hi>Tycho B.</hi> it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued ſixteen Months, after which time
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:55889:25"/>decreaſing very much, it grew quite in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſible.</p>
               <p>Upon the Conſideration of this Star or Comet, is remarkable unto our purpoſe, what the Marqueſs of <hi>Villenes</hi> hath left in Writing in his Book upon the <hi>Centiloqui</hi> of <hi>Ptolemey;</hi> to wit, that there remained a black Spot in the ſame place where this Star appeared; which, if ſo, it would the more confirm what we have ſaid, that the Stars have Spots juſt as the Planets have, the which makes them diſappear at ſuch times as they turn from wards the Earth. Never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs ſeeing the Aſſertion of this Marqueſs is not ſeconded by other Authors, we will refer our ſelves unto farther Experience.</p>
               <p>It is doubtful if this ſame Star will not come and appear again. All we can con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude of this Queſtion is, that if it be a real fixed Star, it will not fail appearing ſome other time; but if it be only a Cornet, or that it is in the Firmament it ſelf, or a little below it, then it will never appear again.</p>

               <p>ACCording to thoſe forementioned <hi>Ara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bians,</hi> the mean diſtance of the Moon (that is taking her when ſhe is neither far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theſt off from, nor neareſt to the Earth, but in a middle motion) is forty nine half Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meters of the Earth: that is about 1103881 <hi>Italian</hi> Miles.</p>
               <p>This it is plain <hi>Copernicus</hi> thought too little, and therefore went not about any particular Calculation of her diſtance, but only in general has told the World, he looks
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:55889:33" rendition="simple:additions"/>upon the compaſs of the great Orb to be ſo vaſt, that the Earth compared thereto is only as a Point; But <hi>Tycho Brahe</hi> having made ſtricter Obſervations and Calculati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, affirms the diſtance of the Moon from the Earth to be 56½ of the Earths Semidia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meters; And <hi>Philippus Lansbergius</hi> yet more, namely, of fifty nine Semidiameters.</p>
               <p>So that ſhould we compute at the loweſt rate, taking <hi>Ptolemey</hi>'s Meaſures, the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſs of the Moons Orb muſt be upwards of 6645348 <hi>Italian</hi> Miles, for its Diameter made up of the Moons diſtance from the Earth twice taken, and of the Diameter of the Earth will be 2215116 Miles, which multiplied by three (the round number, to avoid Fractions) gives the forementioned Sum; A vaſt Orb indeed, yet far the leaſt of any of the Planetary ones.</p>
               <p>Now as to the bulk or bigneſs of the Moons Body, it is eſtimated commonly by the proportion it bears to the Body of the Earth. Thoſe that follow <hi>Ptolomey</hi> account it thirty nine times leſs than the Earth; But <hi>Copernicus</hi> tells us roundly 'tis about forty three times leſs; <hi>Lansbergius</hi> forty five times and an half; And <hi>Tycho Brahe</hi> forty two. <hi>

               <p>AFter what has been ſaid of the Moon, all will be much plainer touching both the other Planets and fixed Stars, of which we will firſt conſider <hi>Mercury</hi> and <hi>Venus,</hi> whom we thus put together, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they alſo, as the Moon, are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly thought leſs than the Earth, though far more diſtant than the Moon.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Mercury</hi> is by the <hi>Ptolomaicks</hi> thought to be 115 half Diameters of the Earth diſtant from the Earth; but by <hi>Tycho Brahe</hi> 1150; and by <hi>Lansbergius</hi> 1500.</p>
               <p>Now if we will reckon according to <hi>Pto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomey, Mercury</hi> will be 480355 Miles di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant from the Earth, whichnumber if we double, and add thereto the Diameter of the Earth, <hi>viz.</hi> 8354, we have the Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meter of his Orb, <hi>viz.</hi> 969064 — Miles; which number if we treble, we have near about the compaſs of his Orb, <hi>viz.</hi> 2907192 — but if we take the other Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts 'tis vaſtly bigger.</p>
               <pb n="38" facs="tcp:55889:35"/>
               <p> As to his Body, <hi>Ptolomey</hi> ſuppoſed him 19000 times leſs than the Earth, (a prodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious miſtake certainly) <hi>Tycho Brahe,</hi> who is more herein to be credited, only nineteen times leſs, (by which he ſhould be above as big again as the Moon) and <hi>Lanſbergius</hi> only twice leſs. His apparent Diameter is judged only of two minutes or thereabouts, but <hi>Martinus Hortenſius,</hi> a Diſciple of <hi>Lanſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bergius,</hi> making uſe of his Teleſcope, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits <hi>Mercury</hi>'s Body to be only nineteen Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conds; which Computation may be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt others a good reaſon for his being ſo ſeldom ſeen.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Venus</hi> comes next; By the <hi>Ptolomaick Syſtem</hi> diſtant from the Earth 618 Semidia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meters of the Earth; By the <hi>Tychonick</hi> 1150; By <hi>Lanſbergius</hi>'s 1500.</p>
               <p>Now if we will reckon again according to the loweſt rate, which is that of <hi>Pto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomey</hi>'s, <hi>Venus</hi> will be 2581386 — Miles diſtant from the Earth; which number of we double, and add thereto the Diameter of the Earth, <hi>viz.</hi> 8354, as above, we have the Diameter of her Orb; and that num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber if we treble, as before, we have (nearly) the Compaſs of her Orb, <hi>viz.</hi> 15513378 — which yet it is apparent others would make vaſtly larger.</p>
               <pb n="39" facs="tcp:55889:35"/>
               <p> As to the bulk of this glorious Star, <hi>Pto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomey</hi> makes it twenty eight times leſs than the Earth, <hi>Tycho</hi> only ſix times leſs, and <hi>Lanſbergius</hi> but three and a third part. Her apparent Diameter according to the firſt is of three Minutes; according to the ſecond of three and a quarter; but <hi>Martinus Hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinſius,</hi> a Diſciple and Aſſiſtant of <hi>Lanſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bergius,</hi> obſerving her by good Teleſcopes, ſuppoſes her Diameter only of fifty nine Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conds.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Mars</hi>'s mean diſtance from the Earth ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to <hi>Ptolomey</hi> is Four thouſand five hundred eighty four half Diameters of the Earth; his apparent Diameter of one Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nute and an half; and his Body once and an half bigger than the Earth.

Now <hi>M.

               <p>
                  <hi>Saturn</hi> the higheſt of the Planets comes laſt, whom <hi>Ptolomey</hi> placed Fifteen thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand and eight hundred Semidiameters of

               <pb n="44" facs="tcp:55889:38"/>
               <p> 
                  <hi>Ptolomey</hi> (at leaſt the forementioned <hi>Ara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bians</hi> deducing it from his Principles) have placed the fixed Stars Nineteen thouſand Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midiameters of the Earth diſtant from it. <hi>Tycho</hi> honeſtly telling us, that no exact or certain meaſures can be taken in this caſe, conjectures them to be near about Fourteen thouſand ſuch Semidiameters diſtant. As to the <hi>Copernicans</hi> they have another way of meaſuring, of which anon.</p>
               <p>The fixed Stars are judged very far from being all of a bigneſs; And ſince the invention of Teleſcopes, it is certain there are a multitude of them either ſo ſmall, or ſo far off us, that they cannot be ſeen by our naked Eye; however according to the uſual eſtimate, they are taken to be of ſix ſeveral Magnitudes. Thoſe of the firſt rate are conceived One hundred and eight times bigger than the Earth; ſuch are, the big<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger Dog-Star, the Bulls-Eye, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Thoſe of the ſixth and leaſt rate only eighteen times bigger than it, according to <hi>Alphraganus</hi> his Account; but <hi>Albategnius,</hi> his Brother <hi>Ptolomaick,</hi> varies a little, not very much worth inſiſting on. However behold his whole eſtimate of all the Mundane Bodies. <hi>If we compare</hi> (ſays he) <hi>all the Mundane Bodies as to their bigneſs, we muſt acknowledge the Sun to take the firſt place, as biggeſt of them all; next him the fixt Stars of the firſt
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:55889:38"/>Magnitude; in the third place</hi> Jupiter, <hi>in the fourth</hi> Saturn, <hi>in the fifth the reſt of the five Orders of the fixt Stars, according to their Magnitudes of</hi> 2, 3, 4, 5, <hi>and</hi> 6<hi rend="sup">th</hi> 
                  <hi>Rate, in the ſixth place</hi> Mars, <hi>in the ſeventh the Earth, in the eighth</hi> Venus, <hi>in the ninth the Moon, in the tenth and laſt</hi> Mercury. This is alſo generally the <hi>Ptolomeans</hi> Opinion of the ſeveral Bodies in this Syſteme of the World.</p>
               <p>But I ſuppoſe it muſt be underſtood only of ſuch fixt Stars as they knew; for before the invention of Teleſcopes, that infinite number of Stars, which makes up the <hi>Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laxy,</hi> or <hi>Milky Way,</hi> that great number alſo in the Conſtellation of the Pleiades, not ſeen to the naked Eye, as alſo the innume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable number <hi>ſcattered through the Heavens,</hi> diſcoverable by the help of our Glaſſes, were not known, nor therefore eſtimated.</p>
               <p>The Diameter of the Sphere of fixt Stars, if taken according to our old Rule, is about Thirty eight thouſand and two Semidia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meters of the Earth: and therefore its compaſs upwards of One hundred ſeventy four thouſand and ſix ſuch Semidiameters.</p>

               <p>Suppoſing then the Earth to be moved round, the Sun in the Circle here aſſigned to it, that Circle they call the great Orb, and ſuppoſe the Semidiameter of it to be equal to 1500 Semidiameters of the Earth, and the Sphere of the fixt Stars to be diſtant from the Earth 28000 Semidiameters of the great Orb, or which is much about the ſame, forty two millions of the Earths Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midiameters.</p>
               <p>This diſtance indeed is vaſtly greater than either that aſſigned by <hi>Ptolomey</hi> or <hi>Tycho,</hi> but yet admitting the diſtances aſſigned by either of the two later, and meaſuring
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:55889:41"/>the compaſs of the Orb of fixed Stars there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by, it is in a manner unconceivable that that Orb can be carry'd round the Earth in twenty four hours, or in a natural day; for in ſuch caſe its motion muſt be many hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred times more rapid or ſwifter than the Shot out of any Gun. For according to due Computation, the very Sun it ſelf, by the <hi>Ptolomaick</hi> Hypotheſis, muſt move in one minute 13095 <hi>Engliſh</hi> Miles, and in an hour 783715 Miles; but the fixed Stars moſt vaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly more, namely 13513686 <hi>Engliſh</hi> Miles in one hour, and in one minute not leſs than 225228 Miles, which I think no one can well believe. Yet this I ſay would inevi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tably follow upon that diſtance at which <hi>Ptolomey</hi> places both Sun and Fixed Stars from the Earth; and much more upon the diſtance aſſigned by the <hi>Copernicans,</hi> only thoſe indeed help themſelves, by ſuppoſing the Earths daily motion upon its own Ax.</p>

                  <hi>SECT. IX.</hi> Of the boſt way and times of uſing Inſtruments to ſatisfie our ſelves in theſe Curioſities.</head>
               <p>THat the Quadrant (or where a large Quadrant cannot be managed, a Sex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant) and Teleſcopes are the moſt uſeful
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:55889:41"/>Inſtruments for both making and ſatisfying our ſelves in Diſcoveries of this Nature, I think will not be doubted. But certainly the beſt way to uſe them is in conjunction. Its true there may be ſeveral caſes in which we reſpect not much the height or place of a Star; it may be all we deſign is to view its Colour, Form, Spots, or the like, and then the Teleſcope it ſelf may ſuffice. But becauſe Stars appear of different Diameters or ſizes, according to their different height or poſition above the Horizon, therefore we ſhall be able to make the exacteſt Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervations and trueſt Judgment, if we have to the ſide of a large Quadrant (or Sextant) duely fixed a proportionable Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſcope joyned and faſtned. The way of fixing both it is ſcarce poſſible in words ſo to deſcribe as that it will be plainly under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood. But theſe things may eaſily be ſeen, and then moſt readily underſtood, if we go to any Artiſts. And being furniſhed with ſuch a Machin or Inſtrument, the beſt time to uſe it is not in the lighteſt Nights, or when the Moon is at Full, (except on ſome parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular occaſions) for then the Luminous Raies too much confound one another. It is much beſt viewing the Moon at or near its Quarters. But if we will ſee a Full Moon, we muſt have larger and longer Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſcopes than ſuch as can be fixt to Quad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rants:
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:55889:42"/>and there are little Devices to draw the Raies cloſer by putting a Paper with a Pin-hole in it betwixt our Eye and the Glaſs, and the like with a little uſe will eaſily di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect and teach us to contrive.</p>
               <p>Then for the Stars, the beſt time to view any of them is in clear Nights, when there is little or no Moon. A Teleſcope of ſix or eight foot will for theſe, and indeed for the Moon or Sun alſo, do in a manner as well as one of twenty four or twenty five. The diſadvantage of cumberſomneſs in theſe large ones is ſuch as ſcarce countervails the advantages which they have; the chiefeſt of which is, that they take in a greater part of the Heaven than our leſſer Glaſſes.</p>
               <p>But all Perſons muſt be adviſed how they venture to look on the Sun with Teleſcopes. For in due poſition the whole Inſtrument is but as one violent Burning-Glaſs, and a Man may eaſily take ſuch a look in an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant as never to ſee more with that Eye. Therefore ſome uſe to ſmoak their Glaſs over a Candle; but the beſt way is to have a ſmall piece of red or purple Glaſs to interpoſe betwixt your Eye and the Glaſs of the Teleſcope, and by this means you may view that glorious Body with little or no prejudice. But as to theſe points, thoſe
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:55889:42"/>who ſell theſe Inſtruments will certainly, if deſired, ſhew their Cuſtomers the trueſt and ſafeſt way to uſe them, more plainly than I can ſpeak. I will only here add, that if we deſign a clear ſight of the face or bigneſs of any of the Heavenly Bodies, the worſt time to view any of them is when they are not far from the Horizon; for then the refraction of the Raies is ſo great, that their Bodies appear much larger proportionably than at other times, and in other poſitions, and the ſight of them too is much more confuſed; By which one note, any Perſon may be able to direct himſelf what Stars are in a moſt convenient condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for him to view at any time, when his Curioſity leads him to ſuch Entertainments, And truly theſe are Entertainments ſo noble and glorious, as well as raviſhing and tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porting, that it is to be wondred how Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons whoſe Parts and Fortunes qualifie them for them, are able to temperate them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves from them.</p>
               <p>But perhaps it will be ſaid the uncertainty of the truth of them diſcourages. Of that therefore we will conſider in the next place.</p>

               <p>To come to a perfect and exact know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the diſtance of the Heavenly Bodies, (by Miles or ſuch known meaſures) of their bigneſs, ſubſtance, frame, and contexture is not to be expected: nor will any, except Madmen, pretend to have made ſuch Diſcoveries. There are very few things which Wiſe Men will ſay they tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roughly underſtand, even amongſt theſe Sublunary Bodies. But there is as great a difference betwixt the knowledge which Artiſts and Speculative Men have of the Heavens, Stars, and Orbs, and that which the Common People have, as there is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the Common Peoples and Brutes no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tices of them. To come to particulars.</p>
               <p>The Parallax of the Moon is very ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly diſcoverable. Its Horizontal Parallax is above a whole Degree. Therefore the diſtance of the Moon may be more certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly concluded upon, and more firmly cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dited. In the other Stars I confeſs the Caſe is more difficult, and the Work finer, ſo
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:55889:43"/>that the Reſult exceeds not probability. For in <hi>Mercury, Venus,</hi> the <hi>Sun,</hi> and <hi>Mars,</hi> we cannot without great difficulty obſerve any Parallax, and that which we can at length obſerve is very ſmall. In <hi>Jupiter</hi> and <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn</hi> there is ſcarce any. And as to the fixed Stars they are ſo vaſtly above us, that we are to expect none in them. The rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon hereof is, that the Semidiameter of the Earth, which is taken in theſe Caſes for the common Meaſure, and as the interſtice be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the two ſuppoſed Dimenſory Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, bears ſome ſenſible proportion to the diſtance of the Moon; but as to the diſtance of thoſe other Bodies, its proportion is ſo very ſmall, as almoſt to vaniſh when ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied thereto. As if the Earth were but in compariſon of them as a Point, and there were no difference whether we beheld them from the Surface of the Earth, or from its Center. By which ingenuous dealing the Reader will be able eaſily to gather what kind of belief he is to give to the foregoing Calculations or Accounts of the diſtances and Magnitudes of theſe Bodies. They are moſtly but the Conjectures of Men very learned, knowing, and induſtrious in this kind.</p>
               <pb n="54" facs="tcp:55889:44"/>
               <p> And as to thoſe Diſcoveries mentioned in the firſt part of this Book, it may perhaps be ſuſpected they are alſo as uncertain, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of the diverſity of Refractions and <hi>Mediums,</hi> the vaſt diſtance and other like Points. But it is to be ſaid hereto; Thoſe Objects which conſtantly through divers Glaſſes, at divers times, and by divers Spectators obſerved, ſtill generally, or moſt commonly appear the ſame, are certainly as they appear. <hi>Saturn</hi> therefore moſt ſurely has ſuch <hi>Anſulae</hi> of Light as he is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented. <hi>Jupiter</hi> has ſuch Obſcurer Tracts as thoſe termed his <hi>Belts</hi> or <hi>Girdle. Mars</hi> ſuch Features as I may call them as above deſcribed. The <hi>Sun</hi> and <hi>Moon</hi> ſuch <hi>Spots.</hi> And <hi>Venus</hi> her different <hi>Phaſes,</hi> ſometimes as an Half, Quarter, or Full Moon. And there are none of theſe but are far a more glorious Light than they can be conceived, when ſeen only in ſuch Figures, as we have been able to repreſent them in. The ſeeing them as near as we can by the help of our Glaſſes, in themſelves fills the Fancy with delightful news Idea's, and the Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding with new curious Contemplations, and prepares and raiſes the Mind to moſt Noble, Curious, and Divine Speculations, as well as Wonder and Content. Then as to thoſe <hi>New Stars,</hi> (as I may call them)
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:55889:44"/>that is, ſuch Stars as we cannot eſpy with our naked Eye, but do plainly ſee, and can count with the help of our Glaſſes; (ſuch as are not only very many little ones, but one larger of the ſeven Stars in the <hi>Pleiades,</hi> that infinite multitude in the <hi>Gallaxy</hi> or <hi>Milky Way, &amp;c.</hi>) Theſe are moſt certain things, and not meer appearances: becauſe if an hundred People look at them, and have one hundred Teleſcopes, they ſhall all ſee the ſame Stars, and be able to count them, and deſcribe their Poſition, or the Figures they make as they ſtand all along in the Tracts of the Heavens. Theſe there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore can be no ſparklings of Light, or falſe appearances in the Glaſſes, but muſt be real and proper Stars: ſome of them cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly very vaſtly above the others, and having different Centers of motion, or dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent Orbs from the others. Moſt of theſe things therefore cannot be doubted.</p>
               <p>And <hi>de facto,</hi> it is not now doubted, I think, by any who have uſed Teleſcopes in viewing the Heavens, that in the <hi>Firma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> as it is uſually called, or Sphere of fixed Stars, there are ſeveral Stars which have a peculiar motion of their own, and are as it were Suns too, and illuminate others, as our Sun does the Moon and other Planets.
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:55889:45"/>But the Theory of theſe things would lead us into heights as far beyond our Conce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption and Comprehenſion, as above our Sight. We will therefore here ſit down a while and wonder, and put a ſtop to our thoughts of the Stars.</p>
